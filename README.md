# Mirrorsync
## Purpose
Mirrorsync by CodeOOf is a mirroring tool for synchronizing repositories over 
the network to local storage. This can be used to keep local mirrors up to date 
via chrone or just a one time download. Currently this can handle:
* Using the rsync provider to mirror repositories
* Handle multiple repositories
* Mangage version exclusion from source to minimize local footprint

## Installation
This installation shows how this can be done using local service account.
